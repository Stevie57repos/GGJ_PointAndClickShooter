## Game Description

Have some fun blasting capsules in our on-rails FPS training simulator. Inspired from the old light-gun arcade games such as Virtual Cop, Time Crisis and House of the dead. Not all capsules are enemies though. Players need to destroy the redc capsules while keeping the blue capsules alive.
